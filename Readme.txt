This Python script performs 2D truss analysis using the stiffness matrix method, visualizes the structure and internal forces, and writes the displacements and member forces/stresses to an Excel file.

Features-
Reads structured input from a single Excel sheet.
Computes nodal displacements, member forces, and stresses.


Visualizes:
Truss structure with applied loads.

Member forces (tension/compression) with colored thickness representation.

Exports results to new sheets in the same Excel file.

**While running the code again, the new results will be replaced in place of old results in the same sheet.

Checks whether the member stresses exceed a user-specified allowable stress.
